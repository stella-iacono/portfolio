            <h3>Websites I Created:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://stella-iacono.github.io/website/">Hypertext Story</a></li>
                <p>In this website, I used "hypertext" to create a blog about a trip I went on. Using only HTML, I tell a little about places I visited.</p>
                <li><a href="https://stella-iacono.github.io/broadsheet/">Internet Broadsheet</a></li>
                <p>This is a newspaper style broadsheet utilizing typography and grids. Each card contains a different pastry to bake and a link to the recipe.</p>
                <li><a href="https://stella-iacono.github.io/website2/">Transformation</a></li>
                <p>The goal of this website was to create a transformation using JavaScript. Select different features of cars and see an AI generated image of what it might look like. The background transforms when you toggle between 'retro' and 'modern'. </p>
                <li><a href="https://stella-iacono.github.io/painting/">Panting P5.js</a></li>
                <p>I recreated a painting by Paul Klee using a JavaScript library called p5.js. There are three versions of the painting - a static one, an animated one, and an interactive one.</p>
                <li><a href="https://stella-iacono.github.io/mobile/">Campus Bingo</a></li>
                <p>This is a responsive website made for a mobile phone. It's specific to the WWU campus. Try to get five in a row!</p>
                <li><a href="https://stella-iacono.github.io/json/">Top 20 Albums</a></li>
                <p>I created this webpage with a JSON file. All the details about my top 20 albums are displayed using JSON and JavaScript.</p>
                <li><a href="https://stella-iacono.github.io/zee/">Zee (elizabot.js)</a></li>
                <p>This site is a spin on the Eliza chatbot created by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. This version I created, Zee, needs the user to be its therapist.</p>
                <li><a href="https://chatbot-eight-ecru.vercel.app/">Zee Chatbot</a></li>
                <p>This was my final project for my Dynamic Webpages class. It is a re-imagined, updated version of my troubled chatbot, Zee. This version implements an API that I gave a prompt to act as a character I created, and also includes JavaScript.</p>
