            <h3>9 Interesting Websites I Found:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://icration.com/">iCrate Solution</a></li>
                <p>Effective, responsive, engaging website created by a previous professor of mine. It implements many
                    examples of dynamic features using JavaScript and jQuery. </p>
                <li><a href="https://orb.farm/">Orb.Farm</a></li>
                <p>Orb Farm is essentially a pixelated simulation of an ecosystem in a fish tank. You can choose
                    components you want to add to your tank, but the ecosystem needs to stay balanced.</p>
                <li><a href="https://radio.garden/visit/bellingham-wa/rwZegBln">Radio Garden - Bellingham WA</a></li>
                <p>This site allows you to explore live radio all around the world. Click on any part of the globe, or
                    have it find your location to see what's currently on the radio!</p>
                <li><a href="https://screamintothevoid.com/">SCREAM INTO THE VOID</a></li>
                <p>Feeling bottled up? You can dump all your problems into the void on this site. Once you get
                    everything out, it will be gone forever without ever being seen by anyone.</p>
                <li><a href="https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/#google_vignette">Find the Invisible Cow</a></li>
                <p>You could spend hours on this website as you advance levels by finding the hidden cow. It's like a
                    game of hot and cold - the cow's moo gets louder as your mouse pointer gets closer to it.
                    Eventually, you unlock different animals!</p>
                <li><a href="https://hackertyper.com/">Hacker Typer : Fake Coding & Hacker Simulator To Prank & Troll
                        Your Friends</a></li>
                <p>If you've ever wanted to fulfill your dreams as a hacker, but want to actually corrupt anything, this
                    site makes it possible. All you need to do is type, and it will make it look like you are breaking
                    through the firewall.</p>
                <li><a
                        href="https://artsandculture.google.com/experiment/YAGuJyDB-XbbWg?cp=eyJhdG1vc3BoZXJlIjoiamFwYW5lc2UifQ..">Paint
                        With Music — Google Arts & Culture</a></li>
                <p>This site created by Google is an artistic activity to pass time. As you draw on a canvas, you are
                    simultaneously creating music. Each brush stroke you make corresponds to a note played by an
                    instrument. You can then go back and listen to your artwork!</p>
                <li><a href="https://www.howstuffworks.com/">HowStuffWorks - Learn How Everything Works!</a></li>
                <p>If you've ever wanted to know 'how stuff works', this website explains it all. The function of
                    anything and everything can be found here.</p>
                <li><a href="https://www.abathhouse.com/">BATHHOUSE | Day Pass - Massage - Body Scrub - Sauna Near
                        You</a></li>
                <p>This is a website for a company that focuses on wellness. They provide saunas, hot tubs, and
                    massages. It's an entertaining website, and it's interesting to learn about.</p>
